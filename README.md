# Campsite Product Engineer technical exercise

We have a menu that allows the user to select one Slack channel that they'd like to broadcast Campsite posts to. We're updating this feature to give users more control over where their posts are broadcast.

Update the menu so that users can choose zero to many Slack channels. Assume we use our `<Select>` component elsewhere in our app, and it must continue to work as it does today in those places.

The exercise is completely open-book, so feel free to use any resources you'd use in your normal work. We want to know what you thinking, so please talk aloud as you make product and engineering decisions and tradeoffs.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
